Welcome to this week's 3 Minute Monday where we explore three quick but impactful ideas to start your week.

## 1. How to Take Criticism

The ability to receive criticism well is perhaps one of the most underrated skills in personal development. When someone offers you criticism, try this approach:

First, take a deep breath. Your initial reaction might be defense, but pause before responding. Then, consider: "What percentage of this feedback might be true?" Even if it's just 10%, that's valuable information you can use to improve.

Remember that criticism often says as much about the giver as it does about you. The most valuable criticism comes from those who want you to succeed, not those who simply want to tear you down.

## 2. Determining What's Actually True

In an age of information overload, determining what's factual has become increasingly difficult. Here's a simple framework:

Ask yourself: "What evidence would change my mind about this?" If you can't think of anything, you're likely dealing with a belief rather than a fact. Facts should be malleable in the face of compelling evidence.

Look for sources that have incentives aligned with accuracy rather than engagement. And most importantly, be willing to update your views when new information emerges.

## 3. Building a Strong Marriage

After studying thousands of couples, researchers found that the strongest marriages aren't those without conflict – they're the ones where partners turn toward each other's "bids" for connection.

A "bid" is any attempt to connect, whether it's a comment, question, or gesture. Simply acknowledging these small moments builds relationship equity that helps weather the inevitable storms.

The magic ratio? Five positive interactions for every negative one. This doesn't mean avoiding difficult conversations, but rather ensuring your relationship has enough positive moments to balance the challenging ones.

That's it for this week's 3 Minute Monday. Remember, small insights consistently applied can lead to remarkable changes over time.
