            <p>Hello once more,</p>
            <p>Quick question,</p>
            <p>If you could wish for a life without problems, would you take it?</p>
            <p><strong>A life without problems is a problem in itself.</strong></p>
            
            <blockquote></blockquote>
            
            <p>So maybe don’t wish for a life without problems,</p>
            <p>Wish for one with solvable problems instead.</p>
            <p>As you start maturing, you realise that not every problem deserves your entire time and effort. You realise that maybe, just maybe you don’t need to worry about every little thing out there.</p>
            <p>It’s at this moment that you will actually know and understand that,</p>
            <p><strong>Life is life, problems will happen, loved ones will die, and challenges will arise.</strong></p>
            <p>That’s the way things go,</p>
            <p>So, you can focus on one problem and have it consume you, or you can chill out, see what you can do better and find a better way out,</p>
            <p>What’s the worse that could happen? You die, well, spoiler alert: you will. We all do. But until then, why not mess around and see what works?</p>
            <p>Understand that life doesn’t care. Problems don’t RSVP; they just show up.</p>
            <p>One minute, you got one leg on the other coasting along, sipping your hot mint tea in the chilling rainy night, thinking you’ve got it all figured out, and the next; bam, you’re staring into the abyss, questioning everything.</p>
            <p>Why am I even here? What’s the point? Is my shitty Wi-Fi ever gonna stop shitty? You know, the classics.</p>
            <p><strong>Here’s the thing though, just step back a little, and you might just realise your grand existential crisis? It’s not all that special.</strong></p>
            <p>You’re just another fish flapping around in the giant, messy aquarium of humanity.</p>
            <p>We’re all trying to claw our way out of the quicksand of misery, one soggy step at a time.</p>
            <p>Like Kurt Vonnegut once said, <em>“So it goes.”</em> It’s simple, brutal, and a bit hilarious if you squint at it right.</p>
            <p>So as you go about your days, just remember this:</p>
            <p>Life’s a sloppy, chaotic stew of “oh my days” moments. Your car breaks down the day you get paid. Your boss decides 8 a.m. meetings are a personality trait. You spill ketchup on your favorite shirt right before the date you actually care about.</p>
            <p>But here’s the secret sauce: those little disasters? They’re yours. Own ‘em. Laugh at ‘em. And maybe write a script and make ‘em a story or even a movie that is worth telling.</p>

            <h1><strong>WHAT I’VE LEARNED</strong></h1>
            <b>

            </b>

            <h4><strong>1. Problems are just seasoning.</strong></h4>
            <p>Next time you’re drowning in the deep end of your own personal problem pool, just float for a sec.Look around. See what you can change, what you can laugh off, what you can turn into a killer story.</p>
            <p>Problems are gonna happen; big ones, small ones, dumb ones that make you wonder if the universe is tricking you.</p>
            <p>But you? You’re still here, still kicking, still figuring it out. And that’s the most interesting plot twist of all.</p>

            <h4><strong>2. Misery loves company, but it’s one hell of a lousy roommate.</strong></h4>
            <p>A <em>study</em> says folks who dwell on one problem are 47% more likely to miss the good stuff; like that sunset you ignored while doomscrolling.</p>
            <p>(Okay, I might have made that stat up, but it feels true, right?)</p>

            <h4><strong>3. You’re still the main character.</strong></h4>
            <p>I know I said you’re not special and we’re all the same…</p>
            <p>But just bare with me for a minute. You know what?</p>
            <p>Take it from Mr. The Obstacle is The Way Himself,</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><em>“Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It’s not ambition or skill that’ll set you apart but sanity.”</em> — Ryan Holiday</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>With that being said, remember that problems don’t get the last word -you do. Keep your head on straight, and you’re already winning. (Cheesy i know, but God is it so ture?)</p>

            <p>Much Love,</p>
            <p>Yassine X</p>
            <p>PS: Ramadan Mubarak to you all.</p>
